# Operators
Binary Operators - `+ - / * %` - Arithmetic
Unary Operators - `- !` - `side = -side`

`17 / 5 = 3` - Truncation
`double x = 17/5` - gives 3.4

# Compound Operators

`a = a + b` -> `a += b`
`a = a - b` -> `a -= b`
`a = a * b` -> `a *= b`
`a = a / b` -> `a /= b`
`a = a % b` -> `a %= b`

# Relational Operators
`==` - equal to
`!=` - not equal to
`>=` - greater than or equal to
`<=` - less than or equal to
`>` - greater than
`<` - less than

All result in a boolean

# Logical Operators
`&&` - and
`||` - or
`!` - not
