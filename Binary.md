# Binary

Base 2
Only represented in 1s and 0s

`1 0 1 => 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 | 2^2 once + 2^1 zero times + 2^0 once`

`1 1 0 1 => 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13`

Subscript 10 means a number is in decimal

# Octal

Base 8
37 base 8

Subscript 8 means a number is in octal

````

--- => (8^1 * 3) + (8^0 * 7) = 24 + 7 = 31

Base 16
Hexadecimal numbers range from 0 - f

0 in 610 => 000

1 in 610 => 001

6 in 610 => 110

Number = 110001000

3 units in binary are 1 unit in octal

61A in hex => 3032 in octal
