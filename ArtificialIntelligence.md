## What is AI?
- Think like human, the new effort to make computers THINK... machines having minds in the full and literal sense
- Thinking rationally, the study of the computations that makei t possile to perceive, reason, and act
- Act humanly, the study of how to make computers do things at which humans are better at
- Act ratioanlly, the branch of ocmputer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior

## Rational Decisions
- Rational: maximally achieving pre-defiend goals
- Rationality only concerns what decisions are made (not the process behind them)
- Goals are expressed in terms of the utility of the outcomes
- Being rational means maximizing your epxected utility

## Natural Language Understanding
- Speech technologies
	- Automatic speed recognition
	- Dialog systems
- Language Processing Technologies
	- Question answering
	- Machine translation
	- Text classification

## Designing Reational Agents
- An agent is an entity that perceives and acts
- A rational agent selects actions that maximize its (expected) utility

## General themes
- A goal we have in mind
- A mathematical abstraction to formalize this
- Algorithms that operate on these abstractions

## Reflex Agents
- Choose actions based on current percept(& maybe memory)
- May or may not have memory or a model of the world's current state
- Does not consider the future consequences of their actions

## Planning Agents
- Ask "what if"
- Decisions based on (hypothesized) consueqneces of its actions
- Must have a model of how the world evolves in response to actoins
- Most formulate a goal (test)
- Consider how the world would be after action

## Search Porblems
- Consists of:
	- A state space
	- A successor function
	- A start space & a goal list
