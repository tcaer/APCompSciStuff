## Brief, general definition of AI
- AI is the behavior in an autonomous agent
	- It's descrbing the brain, not the body, of "intelligent" machines
	- (AI != robots)
- Driving a car, booking meetings, picking next netflix show
- AGI => artificial general intelligence
	- When a machine can do things in a way that is indistinguishable from human behavior

## Machine Learning
- Machine learning and AI are not the same
- Maching learning is a component of AI
	- The ability for an algorithm to learn from prior data in order to produce a behavior
	- Maching learning is teaching machines to make decisions in situations they have never seen
- Mainstream approach to machine learning is showing the algorithm a data set of situations and telling it what the right decision is => training a model
	- Supervised machine learning

## Deep Learning
- Deep learning is a branch of machine learning
	- Artificial neural networks => algorithms inspired by the way neurons work in the brain
	- Find patterns in raw data by combining multiple layers of artificial neurons
		- As the layers increase, so does the network's ability to learn increasingly abstract concepts
